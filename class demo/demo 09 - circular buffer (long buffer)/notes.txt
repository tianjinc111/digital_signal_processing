demo 09 - circular buffer (long buffer)

Note: The two program produce the same output:

  echo_via_circular_buffer.py
  echo_via_circular_buffer_long.py
But the second program uses a longer buffer than necessary.
In that program, two buffer indices are needed: 
one index for reading from the buffer, 
another index for writing to the buffer.

A long buffer in useful when we need to change
the delay duration in real-time as we process a signal.
For example, the vibrato effect requires a
time-varying delay. So, to implement the 
vibrato effect, we need a buffer that is
longer than necessary.
