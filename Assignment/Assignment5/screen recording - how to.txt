Make a screen recording video demonstrating your solution to [Demo 12 - Ex 1].
In your recording, introduce yourself with the AM effect running.
Your video should not be more than 30 seconds in duration. 
Try to make the sound good (try to avoid clipping, high noise, etc.)

In your video recording, only the output speech (AM-effect speech) should be
audible in the video, not the input speech.
The computer sound should be recorded in the video, but not the microphone audio.
This can be done in a few different ways.

Mac users:
One way is to use QuickTime with a 'Background Music' installed:

Windows users:
You can use 'Xbox Game Bar' (should be installed by default in Win10) and screen record with muted mic.
The only trick is that it records a single window; so you should start your python code, click on the figure and then start recording.
You may press win + G to open this tool. Make sure to mute yourself when doing so.

You may use Zoom to record this video with system audio output and without mic input.
1. Register a personal Zoom account. (It seems that NYU accounts does not allow us to store the recordings locally.)
2. Start a meeting using the personal account. MUTE yourself.
3. Start recording, ignore the warning that the mic input may not be recorded.
4. Share your computer screen in the meeting. In the prompted window, make sure you select "Share computer sound" in the checkbox.
5. Run your Python code.
6. Stop sharing, stop recording, then end the meeting. Now you should be able to get the video file you want.
