3. Record wav files of your voice with identical settings, but use 8-bit and 32-bit formats. For these files,
what values are returned by getsampwidth()?

Answer:
The sample width for 8 bit is 1 and the sample width for 32 bit format is 4


4. The program write_sin_02.py generates a wave file with 32 bits per sample. Use MATLAB to read
sin_02_mono.wav and determine the quantization size. What is the quantization size? How many
quantization levels are there?

the quantization size is 0.0157






5. Use Python to generate a wav file of a sine wave at 8 bits per sample. Read your 8 bit/sample wav file SUBMIT
into MATLAB and plot the signal to verify that it is a sine wave (zoom in if necessary to show the
waveform). Verify that the quantization step size is as expected and verify its spectrum.
(a) Is there any noticeable effect of a lower number of bits/sample on the sound quality (keeping the
same number of samples/second)?
(b) If yes, then try to explain the reasons?
Submit (1) Python code, (2) generated 8-bits wav file, and (3) Matlab code for verifying waveform and
quantization step size, and 4) written comments for answering (a) and (b).


there is not notcieable difference
